richard,1%,1%,jun,2015,200px,Richard is a full stack Python web application built to address the analysis & design piece of a common structural engineering workflow. The application addresses otherwise recurring issues of data scale\, user scale\, and function scale\, while aggregating large amounts of domain expertise into a single point of access. Richard is currently being used by multiple project teams to deliver structural engineering services for what will be one of the world's largest airports. I am responsible for the design and full stack development of the project.
armadillo creche,40%,15%,jan,2011,240px,Armadillo Creche is a 600m2 early childhood development centre in an integrated housing development north of Johannesburg\, South Africa. Alongside a number of professional partners\, it was designed and built by Cornell University Sustainable Design (CUSD). I was responsible for the coordination of the structural design and build scope.
arch1110,70%,10%,jun,2010,80px,ARCH1110 is a summer architecture studio designed to introduce ideas\, principles\, and methods of solving architectural problems. Concepts of space\, form\, function\, and technology are explored through a sequence of graduated design exercises.
cee5072,60%,50%,jan,2012,100px,CEE5072 was an excerise in professional practice involving the stuctural analysis and design of Santiago Calatrava's unbuilt Chicago Spire. The project was student-led with professional guidance from Thorton Thomasetti and Cornell University faculty.
xbridge,75%,35%,jan,2011,100px,XBridge is a footbrige designed in reponse to an overcrowded parking condition at Ithaca's farmer's market. It solves practical concerns with the public space\, while creating a dialogue with nearby towers on Ithaca's East Hill.
Hello\, GSA,15%,35%,apr,2014,160px,Hello\, GSA is a full stack Python web application built as a proof of concept to demonstrate more scalable methods of visualizing structural analysis and design data for larger\, complex buildings projects. Existing measures of data visualization were evaluated alongside new methods of working with different technologies. More scalable solutions were promoted to lower the barrier to entry for data consumption amongst a structural engineering practice.
