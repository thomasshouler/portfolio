richard,5%,5%,jun,2015,12rem,Richard was a Python web application built to address existing challenges with data and user scale within structural analysis & design workflows. In practice\, Richard was used by multiple project teams to support the development of a large airport project composed of 50\,000 tonnes of steel. Key underlying technologies include Celery\, Flask\, Highcharts\, jQuery\, MySQL\, Oasys GSA\, Polymer\, and SQLAlchemy. I was responsible for the design and development of the application.
armadillo-creche,70%,65%,jan,2011,12rem,Armadillo Creche is a 600m2 early childhood development centre in an integrated housing development north of Johannesburg\, South Africa. Alongside a number of professional partners\, it was designed and built by Cornell University Sustainable Design (CUSD). I was responsible for the coordination of the structural design and build scope.
arch1110,85%,10%,jun,2010,5rem,ARCH1110 was a summer architecture studio scoped to introduce ideas\, principles\, and methods of solving architectural problems. Concepts of space\, form\, function\, and technology were explored through a sequence of graduated design exercises.
grasshopper-library,60%,15%,jan,2015,12rem,This was a code block library developed for a visual algorithmic modelling platform\, Grasshopper\, which is widely adopted within the building industry. Components were developed as abstractions around APIs of common industry software\, which colleagues of mine could rapidly assemble into algorithms to solve bespoke design problems. The individual blocks were written in Python and VB.net. I was responsible for the design and development of the code block library.
hello-gsa,30%,40%,apr,2014,9rem,\"Hello\, GSA\" was a Python web application built as a proof of concept to demonstrate more scalable methods of visualizing structural analysis and design data for larger\, complex buildings projects. Existing means of data visualization were evaluated alongside new methods of working with different technologies. More scalable solutions were promoted to lower the barrier to entry for consuming analysis results within a structural engineering practice. Key underlying technologies include Canvas\, Flask\, jQuery\, MongoDB\, Oasys GSA\, three.js\, and WebGL. I was responsible for the design and development of the project.
polythread-pavilion,15%,65%,sep,2015,12rem,PolyThread Pavilion was a gallery installation developed by Jenny Sabin\, and commissioned by the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. The structure of the pavilion was composed of an internal pre-stressed network of knit textile components\, reacting against a bundled fiberglass rod armature. An array of empirical studies were conducted to develop material models for different textiles included within the piece. Material models were then used to construct larger scale analytical representations of the structure to aid in the detailing and design of the armature. I was responsible for the delivery of the project's structural engineering scope with guidance from senior staff.
